    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <h2 class="c11" id="h.30j0zll"><span class="c6 c12">Overview</span></h2>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span>Protos&rsquo;s mission is to empower individuals and small organisations to establish or
            reclaim their digital sovereignty by building a </span><span class="c7"><a class="c1" href="#h.1t3h5sf">self-hosting</a></span><span>&nbsp;platform
            for Internet applications and by promoting the formation of an ecosystem of applications around it</span><span
            class="c0">. By enabling non-technical people to self-host, Protos aims to counteract the powerful trend in
            Internet centralisation and preserve the qualities of the Internet that make it such a powerful catalyst
            for innovation and free exchange of ideas.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <h4 class="c8" id="h.1fob9te"><span class="c13">What is digital sovereignty?</span></h4>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c0">In the context of this text, &ldquo;digital sovereignty&rdquo; refers to the digital
            liberty and independence of an individual, as opposed to a country or geographical location, and it is
            embodied by the following principles:</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <ul class="c14 lst-kix_gutby4kdlmg9-0 start">
        <li class="c5 c10"><span class="c0">Individuals have full control over their digital identities, without being
                dependent on 3rd parties</span></li>
        <li class="c5 c10"><span class="c0">Data generated by an individual is owned by that individual, and only they
                should have the ability to choose what data and how much of it will be shared with other parties</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c0">Digital identity, and the data it accumulates over its lifetime are the basis of the
            digital self, being roughly equivalent to the physical identity and memories of an individual. If the
            reader agrees with this rough analogy, then, it stands to reason that digital identity is a concept worth
            exploring, especially in a world where people are increasingly dependent on their digital devices and the
            Internet.</span></p>
    <h4 class="c8" id="h.3znysh7"><span class="c13">Why is digital sovereignty important?</span></h4>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c0">The internet is one of the most important human creations, and it has changed how
            our species communicate. Its open nature has created a level playing field in terms of access to
            information, and freedom of speech; giving people across the world the power of knowledge, and the ability
            to challenge oppressive authoritarian structures. Clearly, it is worth protecting the openness of the
            Internet and the unencumbered way people access it, and its centralisation threatens those characteristics
            that make it so revolutionary. It is time to reclaim our digital sovereignty and explore alternative
            approaches to using the Internet, approaches that can reverse the feudalistic tendencies eroding the
            principles that the Internet was built upon.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c16 c26"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span>Is there a way to achieve digital sovereignty for an individual through a grassroots movement
            without relying on the existing power meta structures? Protos will focus on </span><span class="c7"><a
                class="c1" href="#h.1t3h5sf">self-hosting</a></span><span class="c0">, a promising approach to using
            Internet applications which is discussed in more detail in the upcoming sections.</span></p>
    <h4 class="c8" id="h.2et92p0"><span class="c13">What are the goals of the Protos?</span></h4>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c0">Protos will pursue its ideology by setting the following goals:</span></p>
    <ul class="c14 lst-kix_4ov2d64vg335-0 start">
        <li class="c5 c10" id="h.tyjcwt"><span>create a </span><span class="c7"><a class="c1" href="#h.1t3h5sf">self-hosting</a></span><span
                class="c0">&nbsp;platform that kickstarts the community by demonstrating a software implementation that
                is easy to use for the end user, but also promotes an application runtime model that is geared towards
                automatic management.</span></li>
        <li class="c5 c10"><span>foster a community of like-minded individuals and organisations that believe in the
                ethos of decentralisation, and can come together and help build the ecosystem required for </span><span
                class="c7"><a class="c1" href="#h.1t3h5sf">self-hosting</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to succeed.
            </span></li>
        <li class="c5 c10"><span class="c0">create and run an application store which will, on one side, allow users to
                download free or paid applications, and on the other, allow developers or application creators to reach
                an audience and potentially monetise their creations.</span></li>
        <li class="c5 c10"><span class="c0">create or leverage an existing cryptographic identity model that allows
                individuals or organisations to retain control over their online identities without relying on 3rd
                parties.</span></li>
        <li class="c5 c10"><span class="c0">create educational material that teaches people how to easily get all the
                functionality they are getting from traditional 3rd party managed Internet applications, by hosting
                their own. </span></li>
        <li class="c5 c10"><span class="c0">long term, incentivise hardware manufacturers to create specialised
                hardware for the purpose of self-hosting; hardware that can be used from home, office or a data center.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c0">At the time of writing, self-hosting is a small niche attractive only to IT
            hobbyists that have the necessary skills and the time to approach it. Protos&rsquo;s meta goal is to change
            that by dramatically lowering the barrier to entry, and opening self-hosting to the average user,
            protecting digital sovereignty in the process.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c11" id="h.3dy6vkm"><span class="c6 c12">Why is Protos needed?</span></h2>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c0">Computing has become ubiquitous, and the internet has fundamentally changed how
            people interact. People have, on a daily basis, come to rely on their smartphones and computers which have
            become deeply interwoven in various aspects of their life, from keeping in touch with their loved ones to
            doing their job more effectively. Despite the tremendous technological progress that has been made, and the
            value created for the average user, the general direction of the digital world has tended towards
            centralisation. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span>Unfortunately, most of our interactions online are now mediated by a handful of hyper-scale
            internet companies, which have massive growths in terms of user base and profits, made possible by the
            powerful economies of scale exhibited by online content aggregators</span><sup class="c17"><a href="#ftnt1"
                id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span>. The modus operandi of the most popular Internet companies is to
            offer free services to vast swaths of people who, through their usage, generate big amounts of data that
            can be monetised in various ways, including being sold to advertisers. This has led to the emergence of
            what Shoshana Zuboff refers to as &quot;surveillance capitalism&quot;</span><sup class="c17"><a href="#ftnt2"
                id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c0">, an economic model that relies on the intermediation and
            monitoring of online interactions and the media people consume; one that creates incentives that are
            fundamentally misaligned with the user.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c0">The explosion in online services has created tremendous value for people, but at the
            same time it has led to an increasingly fragmented Internet. Users have to maintain a separate account for
            each of the service/platform they use, and companies have no incentives for opening up their platforms,
            leading to walled gardens and scattered digital identities. Seen through a simple consumer lens, this
            doesn&#39;t look like a big problem; users have choice and they can stop using a specific service if they
            want too. But looking at the situation through a techno-evolutionary lens, we are forced to acknowledge the
            continuous digitalisation of the world around us, and the increasing importance of our digital identities.
            The data we create in these walled digital gardens are part of our digital identities, and there is no way
            to separate them. As this trend takes its course, our digital identities are becoming more important, and
            they act as gatekeepers to the digital world, yet, they are under the full control of the companies that
            provide them, with users having little recourse in case their accounts get compromised or closed.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c0">The fragmentation of the Internet into islands of data that don&#39;t have the
            ability to talk to each other also means that users and their data are &quot;locked-in&quot; into services
            with no easy way to switch, effectively constraining their digital sovereignty. Because of this asymmetry
            in power, companies have the ability to censor content or completely close accounts that they don&#39;t
            agree with, without noticeable repercussions for themselves. In a world where competition is thriving and
            users don&#39;t incur high switching costs, this wouldn&#39;t be a problem, but that is not the world we
            live in, currently. Certain platforms service billions of users worldwide with little effective choice left
            for them, because of the powerful network effects exhibited by these platforms.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span>Governments around the world have adapted in various ways to the emergence of the networked
            society. Some, like China and Saudi Arabia, have seized the opportunity to reinforce their authority over
            people, and maintain political control. Western governments have had a dissonant approach at best, with
            efforts that range from spying on their citizens to legislation that tries to guarantee certain online
            rights. The Snowden leaks</span><sup class="c17"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;showed
            that the western surveillance machine is far reaching, spanning many countries around the globe, and
            coerces some of the biggest tech companies in its pursue for data. On a more positive note, there are
            legislative efforts that are trying to offer more protection to end users, both from over encroaching
            spying by the government or from data abuses made by Internet service providers. One such effort is the
            GDPR</span><sup class="c17"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;which is useful and
            could lead to positive change, but it is only slightly improving the status quo; laws such as the GDPR
            require service providers to offer certain guarantees regarding user&#39;s data, but they will not lead to
            fundamental changes in the way people consume web applications or online content; the asymmetric power
            relationship between the company and the user will be similar. The same centralisation forces will remain
            in place and perhaps new ones created because of the cumbersome technical requirements imposed by the newly
            created laws. What&#39;s clear is that the centralisation of the Internet into few large companies has
            created a choke point, one that can be targeted and subjugated by state actors, sometimes secretly, and
            without consent from their citizens</span><sup class="c17"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span
            class="c0">.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span>We are left with a situation where our privacy is attacked from two different sides, albeit for
            different reasons: economic from one side, and political from the other. Privacy is an important
            requirement for the democratic process to work smoothly,</span><sup class="c17"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span
            class="c0">&nbsp;and there are already examples where mass surveillance tools have been used to subvert it.
            What was once hailed as a great equaliser and beacon of freedom has been coerced into being a mass
            surveillance machine, one that we are increasingly dependent upon, but unfortunately, don&#39;t have much
            control over. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <h2 class="c11" id="h.1t3h5sf"><span class="c6 c12">Self-hosting - a way to decentralize the internet and attain
            digital sovereignty</span></h2>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c0">The vast majority of web applications in use today use a model where the development
            and the hosting of the application is done by the same company. For example, Gmail, a very popular email
            application, is both developed and hosted by Google on their own hardware servers; when someone uses Gmail,
            they have to use a google owned identity and store all their data, in this case, emails, inside
            Google&rsquo;s service.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c0">In contrast, self-hosting means that instead of relying on a multitude of 3rd party
            web services, each with its own username/password and data silo, individuals and organisations would
            download and run applications themselves on their own personal server or servers(hardware). In this way,
            they would retain control over their own data and fundamentally change the relationship between themselves
            and the application creators. By not being able to leverage user data as a tool to monetise application
            development, a more direct monetisation model would need to be used, one that better aligns the incentives
            of the application developers with those of the users.</span></p>
    <h4 class="c8" id="h.4d34og8"><span class="c13">What are the requirements for self-hosting?</span></h4>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c0">In order to be able to self-host Internet applications and have a good user
            experience, the following parts need to come together:</span></p>
    <ul class="c14 lst-kix_hsj12kq6rseo-0 start">
        <li class="c5 c10"><span class="c4">Internet connected computer that is 24/7 online</span><span>&nbsp;- this
                can be a VPS</span><sup class="c17"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span class="c0">(virtual
                private server) rented from a hosting provider like DigitalOcean or a physical computer at home,
                connected to a reliable connection with a static IP, preferably running the GNU/Linux operating system.</span></li>
        <li class="c5 c10"><span class="c4">Self-hosting platform</span><span>&nbsp;- software that runs on a computer
                that is always on and always connected to the Internet, that provides a way to install and manage
                applications. </span><span class="c7"><a class="c1" href="https://protos.io">Protos</a></span><span>&nbsp;is
                a software project that aims to fill this need, but there are other projects that have similar goals:
            </span><span class="c7"><a class="c1" href="https://sandstorm.io">Sandstorm</a></span><span>,
            </span><span class="c7"><a class="c1" href="https://urbit.org">Urbit</a></span><span>,
            </span><span class="c7"><a class="c1" href="https://cloudron.io">Cloudron</a></span><span
                class="c7">,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;etc.</span></li>
        <li class="c5 c10"><span class="c4">Domain name</span><span>&nbsp;-</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;a
                regular domain name part of the DNS</span><sup class="c17"><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;that
                is used to identify the users and applications that are running on the self-hosting platform. For
                example, a user can be identified as &ldquo;</span><span class="c7"><a class="c1" href="mailto:user@domain.com">user@domain.com</a></span><span
                class="c7">,</span><span class="c0">&rdquo; and an application could be identified as
                &ldquo;mail.domain.com&rdquo;.</span></li>
        <li class="c5 c10"><span class="c4">Applications</span><span>&nbsp;- applications that can be easily installed
                and used through the self-hosting platform. They are the end-goal, because, they provide the value to
                the user.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c0">But the devil is in the details, and having all the required things by themselves
            does not make for a good self-hosting experience, one that can be approachable by average users without
            technical experience. It&rsquo;s important how they come together, to become whole with a smooth user
            experience that hides the parts that create that experience as much as possible; just as you don&rsquo;t
            notice what goes behind the scene to create and display your Facebook feed, installing and using an
            application on a self-hosting platform should be equally boring.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span>Self-hosting is not new, and organisations and technically inclined hobbyists have done it
            since the dawn of the Internet, but the usual way of doing it requires effort and deep technical knowledge.
            Take for example an email server: it requires knowledge on how to install Linux software from the command
            line, have thorough understanding of how the email protocols (SMTP, IMAP etc) work, and know how to
            configure a domain name. And many other server-focused applications pose similar challenges. But there is
            no fundamental reason why that should be the case, a view which is not held only by the </span><span class="c7"><a
                class="c1" href="https://protos.io">Protos</a></span><span>&nbsp;project,
            but increasingly reflected by the various self-hosting software projects that have been started to solve
            this problem: &nbsp;</span><span class="c7"><a class="c1" href="https://sandstorm.io">Sandstorm</a></span><span>,
        </span><span class="c7"><a class="c1" href="https://urbit.org">Urbit</a></span><span>,
        </span><span class="c7"><a class="c1" href="https://cloudron.io">Cloudron</a></span><span>,

        </span><span class="c7"><a class="c1" href="https://solid.mit.edu">Solid</a></span><span
            class="c0">&nbsp;etc. It is becoming clear that the most important pieces of the puzzle that can tie
            everything together to deliver self-hosting into a product with mass appeal, is the self-hosting platform
            and a rich ecosystem of applications that can run on top of it.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <h4 class="c8" id="h.2s8eyo1"><span class="c13">Protos&rsquo;s vision for self-hosting</span></h4>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c7"><a class="c1" href="https://protos.io">Protos</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>can
            be considered a new and 3rd category of (virtual) user devices, next to the smartphone and personal
            computer. This software can run on any computer that acts as a server (always on and always connected to
            the Internet, like a VPS</span><sup class="c17"><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;or
            low power computer at home) and becomes a personal and private &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; for the user, one that
            complements the users other devices just like current Internet services do. As with a smartphone or
            computer, a user can easily download, install, and run applications on the Protos self-hosting platform.
            But the type of applications that run on it differs from the ones running on smartphones or personal
            computers; they could be web applications that can be loaded via the browser, similar to a Google Docs
            document or a Trello board, but could also just be &ldquo;server&rdquo; type software that provides
            functionality to an application on the smartphone or personal computer, like an email server or VPN</span><sup

    <p class="c5"><span>Each Protos instance is identified by a domain name (e.g. domain.com), and can service one or
            more users, a user will be identified by his &lt;username&gt;@&lt;domain name&gt;(e.g. user@domain.com),
            similarly to an email address. Since users have to register a domain when using a self-hosting platform
            like Protos, they have legal ownership over that domain</span><sup class="c17"><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup><span
            class="c0">, so their identity is owned by themselves, without being dependent on a 3rd party organisation.
            Applications running on a Protos instance can authenticate and authorize users belonging to that instance,
            but also, users belonging to other Protos instances.</span></p>

    <p class="c5"><span>Simple applications like Etherpad</span><sup class="c17"><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;are
            ideal to run on Protos, but it is expected that with a wider adoption of self-hosting platforms, more
            complex applications like p2p or federated social networks</span><sup class="c17"><a href="#ftnt13" id="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup><span
            class="c0">&nbsp;will also become more popular, since it will be very easy to run them. For example, the
            oldest and most popular Internet communication application, email, is a federated protocol which works in a
            fully distributed way. Any user can run their own email server on their Protos instance, retaining full
            privacy and control over their data. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>

            typical scenario where a user&rsquo;s devices interact with applications from his Protos instance, but some
            of those applications also interact with applications hosted on other Protos instances. Email, social
            networking, and any other type of application that involves user interactions across instances would work
            in a distributed way, like portrayed in </span><span class="c7"><a class="c1" href="#kix.5f8a3ypbg9i6">Figure

    <h4 class="c8" id="h.3rdcrjn"><span class="c13">Challenges that are impeding the self-hosting vision</span></h4>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c0">While self-hosting as a concept is straightforward, making it into a practical and
            mass-market product is not. There are practical challenges that need be overcome before the vision set
            forth in the previous section can be ready for a wider audience, and these challenges are mostly technical
            in nature: for various reasons, server software has evolved to be complex, hard to install and hard to
            manage but if self-hosting is to become mainstream, this complexity needs to be hidden and the experience
            needs to become more similar to the smartphone experience of installing and managing applications.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span>It all boils down to convenience, and how easily users can adopt and switch to using
            self-hosted applications, in contrast to using services like Gmail and Facebook that offer convenience but
            sacrifice privacy. While current self-hosting projects have made tremendous progress in lowering the
            barriers to self-hosting, a few more leaps in usability are required to reach a level where the technology
            is ready for non-technical people. And that is where the project&rsquo;s effort will be focused, through
        </span><span class="c7"><a class="c1" href="#h.2et92p0">the goals</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;mentioned
            earlier.</span></p>
    <p class="c15 c25"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <h4 class="c8" id="h.26in1rg"><span class="c13">The benefits and ramifications of self-hosting</span></h4>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c0">Making self-hosting a viable alternative to centralised services will bring
            immediate tangible advantages to the people that adopt it, but there are potential long term benefits that
            can affect innovation in the digital world: governance or even democracy itself.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c0">In the short term, using a self-hosting platform like Protos could confer a person
            the following benefits:</span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c16 c4">A single identity.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The user&rsquo;s identity would
            be stable over time, since it would be connected to a domain name that the user owns and controls.</span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c16 c4">Increased privacy.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Since a user&rsquo;s data would
            be under their own control, 3rd parties would not be able to access it without explicit sharing by the
            user.</span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c16 c4">More control and flexibility.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The data and
            applications that are self-hosted can be easily backed-up and moved to a new hosting provider or an
            Internet connected computer at home.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span>In the grand scheme of things, a world in which more people used self-hosting platforms with
            strong security and cryptographic primitives would lead to a more geographically diverse and resilient
            Internet, but also, one that changes the dynamics of state-sponsored attacks on the Internet
            infrastructure. An Internet where communications are encrypted and have a diverse geographical distribution
            makes those kinds of attacks more difficult, and requires them to be more targeted. This doesn&rsquo;t
            totally strip law enforcement of their tools to pursue criminal activity, but it makes it difficult for
            them to use the kind of mass surveillance tools revealed by the Snowden</span><sup class="c17"><a href="#ftnt14"
                id="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;leaks. Countries that keep a strong grip over the
            online behaviour of their populations would find it much more difficult to do so, and in tumultuous
            situations like uprisings or revolts against oppressive governments, people would have much more resilient
            tools to coordinate with.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c0">Another potential outcome of a more decentralised world where users are not locked
            out of their own data is more innovation at the application level, because of lower switching costs between
            applications. If someone installs an application on his Protos instance, the data created by that
            application will be under his control; if a new, better application that understands the same data format
            appears, that person will be able to install it and import the data from the old application without being
            forced to continue using the old one. That plus-extensible protocol can act as a catalyst for innovation,
            eliminating the ability for gatekeepers to form around successful communities. Imagine if Facebook or
            Twitter would be interoperable, or if 3rd party clients could be possible; most likely, it would lead to
            more competition and better outcomes for the users.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span>Last but not least, self-hosting can act as a bridge to the exciting and experimental world of
            public blockchains</span><sup class="c17"><a href="#ftnt15" id="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup><span>. The
            publication of the Bitcoin whitepaper in late 2008, and the following release of the Bitcoin software, was
            a defining moment in the history of the Internet, it proved that it is possible to create digital value
            tokens in a fully decentralised way and without a central authority. That inspired a whole range of wild
            but promising projects, which, through the power of peer-2-peer digital consensus, try to revolutionize
            various fields, with examples such as governance</span><sup class="c17"><a href="#ftnt16" id="ftnt_ref16">[16]</a></sup><span>,
            currency issuing,</span><sup class="c17"><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;and
            media streaming</span><sup class="c17"><a href="#ftnt18" id="ftnt_ref18">[18]</a></sup><span class="c0">.
            Most of these projects are based on peer-2-peer software that benefits from being online 24/7, and requires
            considerable resources to run, which means that running them on a smartphone or laptop would be difficult.
            On the other hand, self-hosting platforms like Protos are the ideal place to run this kind of software
            projects because of their always-on/always-online nature, and this could be a new avenue for delivering
            such projects to a wider and more diverse audience, without repeating history and relying on 3rd party
            providers susceptible to the forces of centralisation. Running a Bitcoin node or a similar blockchain
            project would be transformed from an endeavour that requires deep technical knowledge, to one that requires
            only an economic commitment (the cost of online hosting).</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c0">In a world that is increasingly dependent on digital infrastructure, maintaining our
            digital sovereignty is more important than ever, and to that avail, one of the best tools we have is
            self-hosting.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <h2 class="c11" id="h.lnxbz9"><span class="c6 c12">Addendum</span></h2>
    <h4 class="c8" id="h.35nkun2"><span class="c13">Why do servers need to be always on?</span></h4>
    <p class="c5"><span>Most of our online interactions are asynchronous, which means that most Internet applications
            require always-on software servers</span><sup class="c17"><a href="#ftnt19" id="ftnt_ref19">[19]</a></sup><span
            class="c0">&nbsp;to mediate these interactions. To illustrate this the following e-mail scenario is given,
            although the same pattern applies to other time of online interactions:</span></p>
    <p class="c23"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span>When Alice(</span><span class="c7"><a class="c1" href="mailto:alice@gmail.com">alice@gmail.com</a></span><span>)
            sends an email to Bob(</span><span class="c7"><a class="c1" href="mailto:bob@yahoo.com">bob@yahoo.com</a></span><span>),
            Alice&rsquo;s email client transmits the email first to the email server</span><sup class="c17"><a href="#ftnt20"
                id="ftnt_ref20">[20]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;that represents gmail.com. Once gmail.com&rsquo;s
            email server has the email, it will attempt to deliver the email to yahoo.com&rsquo;s email server. If all
            goes well, the next time Bob&rsquo;s email client goes online and retrieves it&rsquo;s email from
            yahoo.com&rsquo;s email server, it will see the new email from Alice. This explanation simplifies the
            actual process to some degree, but it&rsquo;s accurate enough to illustrate that in order for Bob to be
            able to receive an email when his computer or smartphone is not online, he needs an email server that is
            always online to accept the email on his behalf. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <h4 class="c8" id="h.44sinio"><span class="c13">What facilitated the centralisation of the Internet?</span></h4>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c0">It is important to understand the forces that lead to centralisation, because, those
            also made Internet applications more accessible to the masses, so, potential solutions will have to take
            that into account. There are a multitude of reasons for why the Internet became more centralised, but there
            were a couple of major forces that contributed; economic forces driven be economies of scale, which in turn
            were facilitated by technological innovations in the way software is developed and delivered. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c0">The economic forces are more obvious and have been touched upon, earlier in this
            text. It started with the commercialisation of the Internet, and the modus operandi remains the same;
            companies seek to gain a market advantage by attracting masses of users and then, locking them on their
            platforms through various means: Microsoft did it by bundling IE with Windows, and implementing proprietary
            plugins for it; Facebook does it by creating a network effect among its users and the content they generate
            on its platform, without being interoperable to other social networks; and Google does it by slowly
            re-producing functionality offered by other popular services (or acquiring them), so that users don&rsquo;t
            have to go outside of its ecosystem. The pattern is always similar, and perhaps this shouldn&rsquo;t
            surprise us; companies benefit from economies of scale and market monopolies, and it is no surprise they
            tend to gravitate towards that. This is not a fundamental problem as long as there is healthy competition
            in the market, but the problem is that currently, we are in a situation where the Internet is dominated by
            a handful of global players which have near monopolies in their segments of activity.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c0">While companies tend to want to grow as big and as fast as possible, they can only
            do that as fast they can acquire customers or revenue. In the first stages of the personal computing
            revolution, software was shipped to the user using portable storage media like CD&rsquo;s, and
            increasingly, over the Internet, once it became more popular. The user had to actively be part in the
            software supply chain by first acquiring it, and then installing it on the operating system running on
            their computer. This meant that considerable effort and knowledge was required of the user, to install and
            keep software updated; and since each piece of software had to be compiled for a specific operating system,
            it took considerable effort for developers to target multiple platforms; both of these constraints limited
            the total addressable market of software.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span>1995 was the year that marked the start of a new Internet and computing era, because,
            JavaScript was introduced by Netscape; JavaScript allowed developers to ship code with every web page, code
            that could interactively modify that web page based on input from the user, or data from the web server.
            Developers were no longer limited to slow static websites that had to be updated on the server, but could
            now create interactive applications right in the browser; applications that would act and feel similarly to
            normal desktop graphical applications. </span><span class="c16">(While there have been several in-browser
            multimedia content technologies like Flash or ActiveX, JavaScript has now prevailed in terms of browser and
            developer mindset, and is used in the vast majority of web applications.)</span><span>&nbsp;This technology
            was crucial, because, it changed the software supply chain by eliminating the user from the installation
            equation, and allowed developers to, more or less, target multiple platforms. To take Gmail as an example,
            a web application with over 1 billion monthly active users, a user only needs to visit its website at
        </span><span class="c7"><a class="c1" href="https://mail.google.com">https://mail.google.com</a></span><span
            class="c0">&nbsp;using a web browser, and the latest version of the application will load and become usable
            in a matter of seconds, without any help or knowledge from the user. At the same time, Gmail developers can
            continuously develop the applications, and push updates as soon as they are ready. </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c0">The leap in efficiency in this way of creating and delivering software cannot be
            overstated, and it enabled some of the hyper-scale Internet companies like Google or Facebook to acquire
            large amounts of users in relatively few years. The importance of a smooth application delivery model seems
            obvious now, and it has been repeated in a second computing revolution, the smartphone revolution. Android
            and iOS, the dominant smartphone ecosystems, have application stores that are similarly smooth when it
            comes to delivering applications to the user. You can install and start using an application in seconds,
            and they are kept up to date without requiring any effort from the user. But there is a fundamental
            difference between the smartphone application stores and the Web: the former are closed platforms while the
            latter is an open platform. This shows that a platform&rsquo;s success is conditioned in large part by how
            easy it is for a user to plug in on that platform and gain value.</span></p>
